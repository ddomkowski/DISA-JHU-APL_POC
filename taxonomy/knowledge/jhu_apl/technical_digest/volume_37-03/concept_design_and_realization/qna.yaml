      Highly nonlinear and dynamic mechanical behavior involving impact, crash, and blast is 
      common in some of the work done at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory 
      (APL). Modeling these behaviors involves finite element analysis (FEA) that reaches beyond 
      typical static analyses. APL researchers are able to model complex nonlinear dynamic behavior 
      without oversimplifying or converting the problem to a so-called equivalent static problem. 
      Presented here is an overview of dynamics and nonlinearity and a brief summary of the options 
      available for modeling these behaviors. The article concludes with several case studies that 
      demonstrate how APL's expertise in this area contributes to the safety of our nation's 
      warfighters and diplomatic personnel.
      ## INTRODUCTION
      Blast, impact, and ballistics are the legacies and the poster children of nonlinear dynamic 
      finite element analysis (FEA). Sometimes termed hydrocodes because of their original uses for 
      solving hydrodynamic problems$^{1}$ such as those researched in the Department of Energy labs, nonlinear dynamics FEA software programs, as well as the challenges in using them, are often associated with specialty users at national laboratories or in academia. In fact, researchers in APL's Research and Exploratory Development Department (REDD) and its progenitors have been tackling problems like these for years on projects that span the entire Laboratory. The field has earned a reputation for being difficult and expensive and requiring long lead time because  of the resources required to set up, debug, and run the simulations. However, REDD researchers have combined advances in software and hardware with their extensive experience to open the 
      door to incorporating nonlinear dynamic FEA into the normal design and evaluation process.
      ## BACKGROUND
      ## Dealing with Dynamics
      FEA has become ingrained in engineering design, especially with the advent of graphical user interface (GUI)-driven model development in legacy FEA software packages like ANSYS, which streamlined analyses for the average user. Most engineers and analysts with experience in structural FEA are familiar with static problems, and possibly even problems with a small degree of nonlinearity. However, most of these same analysts are just as unfamiliar with dynamic FEA. In fact, many will seemingly go the extra mile to convert a dynamic problem into a static one, or come up with static-equivalent loads to avoid a dynamic problem.

      - question: |
          What type of mechanical behavior does APL model instead of typical static analyses?
        answer: |
          APL models mechanical behaviors using finite element analysis (FEA) that reaches beyond 
          typical static analyses. APL researchers are able to model complex nonlinear dynamic 
          behavior and presents several several case studies that demonstrate how APL's expertise in this area contributes to the safety of our nation's warfighters and diplomatic personnel.

      ## HARDWARE REVERSE ENGINEERING
      Reverse engineering is the practice of attempting to recreate an object that already exists. With the current tools, reverse engineering is often used to bring physical objects into the digital space for purposes such as:
      - · Replicating a product or component exactly
      - · Reproducing a product or component with additional functionality
      - · Redesigning a product or component for improved performance
      - · Repackaging a product or component
      - · Repairing or replacing damaged components
      - · Regenerating surfaces or geometry for use in a virtual environment, CAD, or finite element modeling (FEM)
      The resulting virtual representation of a reverseengineered part or component can be included in that part's digital twin environment. "A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision-making." 6
      Before technological advances such as CAD, reverse engineering primarily focused on physically rebuilding an object using rudimentary measuring tools like calipers and scales, making molds to copy a part, or recreating a part's geometry using photographs. Reverse engineering tools have evolved to encompass multiple advanced techniques to capture 3-D data of varying resolution. New areas of expertise are required to gather and process the data. Modern reverse engineering tools and techniques include coordinate measuring machines, laser scanning, photogrammetry, and x-ray computed tomography (CT). These capabilities generate data points that can produce CAD geometry for a variety of outputs.

       This article describes APL's critical manufacturing contributions to four recent programs: (1) the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART); (2) the Boundary Layer Transition (BOLT) hypersonic flight experiment; (3) the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP); and (4) the Europa Clipper and Martian Moons eXploration (MMX).
       ## RAPID REDESIGN AND FABRICATION FOR NASA'S DART MISSION
       NASA's DART$^{1}$ was the world's first planetary defense test mission. APL built and operated the DART spacecraft and managed the DART mission for NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office as a project of the agency's Planetary Missions Program Office. As the spacecraft was being prepared for its November 2021 launch, issues with the mirror assembly on its single instrument, the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO), were discovered during vibration testing. The camera's mirror sustained damage because the hanger it was bonded to was not flexible enough to withstand the vibrations that would occur during launch. Engineers from APL collaborated with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center engineers and determined that an undercut on the mounting surfaces would provide the required flexibility, but they were unsure what was possible within the short time frame before the launch. Many discussions among engineers and fabricators culminated in a solution: a custom undercut tool. The fabrication team designed a four-flute form keyseat cutter (Figure 1), and a custom tooling company manufactured it according to the design specifications. Using this tool, the fabricator was able to modify the hanger so that it could correctly mount the mirror.
       The process of fabricating the flexible hanger involved many steps. The material for the part, a nickel-iron alloy, offers thermal expansion and good strength but is difficult to machine. Therefore, all machining was completed on a five-axis milling machine
